# Dozo

**Dozo** is a campus-focused Android application designed to enable peer-to-peer item delivery within a college environment, especially for hostel residents.

The application allows students to request items from nearby markets while other students can accept and deliver those requests in exchange for a small delivery incentive.

## 💡 Motivation

Hostel students often need everyday essentials such as snacks, stationery, medicines, or daily-use items from nearby markets. However, leaving the hostel is not always convenient due to time constraints, academic workload, or personal reasons.

At the same time, other students may already be heading outside.

**Dozo connects these students efficiently.**

- One student posts a request for required items  
- Another student accepts the request and delivers the items  
- The delivery partner earns extra money  
- The requester receives items without leaving the hostel  

This system promotes collaboration, convenience, and micro-earning opportunities within the campus.
